# CICF Week 6 Exercise 1
#
# Get the OpenAlex record for the 2023 World Malaria Report and print the DOI for the publication.
# There are a few ways to do it.
#
# The OpenAlex ID for the report is w4391379888
#
# If you use jq, the "raw output" option -r will remove the double quotes around the doi.


# fetch the json record
# extract the DOI from it
echo "replace this line to output the DOI"
