# CICF Week 4 Exercise 1

For this exercise you will make a pull request.
Do the following.

1. Fork the repository [dbrower/cicf-2025](https://github.com/dbrower/cicf-2025).
(yes, this is reusing something from last year).
2. Make a clone of your fork on your codespace (perhaps at `/workspaces/cicf-2025`)
  (Important! you will need an access token as described in the readme.)
3. Make a branch named `add-random`
4. Make a file named for your username (e.g. `dbrower` for me), and containing a random number between 0 and 1 million.
5. Commit your new file, and push the branch back to your fork
6. Make a pull request to merge this branch with the main branch in my repository (dbrower/cicf-2025)


If you can't think of a random number, perhaps this one?

    python -c "import random; print(random.randint(0,1000000))"
